    <p>Jozef "Dodo" Dubán was the singer and guitarist of the Tublatanka band.
Since Maťo Ďurinda could not find a replacement for the departing Paľo Horváth, he approached Dodo Dubán. He accepted the offer and joined Tublatanka. In the new line-up of the popular hard-rock band, Dubán played backing guitar and also co-wrote some songs. In 1995, they recorded the album Znovuzrodenie. Dodo Dubán recorded his second and last studio album with Tublatanka in 2001, titled Pánska jazda.
After his girlfriend Jana Šomóšiová, with whom he had lived for eight years, left him, Dodo Dubán suffered from depression. He jumped out of the window of his seventh-floor apartment. That day, he and Tublatanka were supposed to christen the selection album Zlatá Tublatanka 20 rockov.</p>

    <p>The legendary rock band Tublatanka has prepared a new single for its fans, Phoenix Without Wings. The song is about a person who tries to cope with life and not give up, even when he hits rock bottom. And he continues to pursue his dream like the mythical Phoenix, who rose from the ashes and took off. Tublatanka wanted to shoot a video for the new song in a quarry, but frontman Maťo Ďurinda fell from a rock and broke his arm while visiting it! Even though Maťo is currently unable to play the guitar, he tells his fans that Tublatanka will perform all of its scheduled concerts!</p>  </div>

<p>After a spectacular success, Tublatanka and Citron are leaving for the second part of the Souboj Rebelů tour in the Czech Republic!<br>
After a year, the Czechoslovak music legends are going on a joint tour of the Czech Republic called Souboj Rebelů Tour 2019! In the spring of this year, the rock bands played an extremely successful tour, on which they sold out eleven halls in the Czech Republic, and therefore they will meet again to continue this phenomenal success!<br>
Don't miss this honest rock blast full of energy.<br>
On the spring tour, a joint composition was created - a duet by Maťo Ďurinda and Láďa Křížek "Strong and unbreakable" about the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the friendship between the two states, which was played at the end of each concert and the fans will also hear it in the second part of the tour.<br>
At the Souboj Rebelů Tour 2019, fans can expect a new, monstrous scene full of great effects and new video animations. Citron will present and offer a new single, which will be a harbinger of a new studio album.
<br>
At the same time, fans will be able to buy the new mini DVD Tublatanka / Citron, which was filmed this year in Prague's Malá Sportovní hall.<br>
You have something to look forward to again!.</p>
